This is an image converter from odg to bmp.
The odg format is a vector represented format and it is stored in xml.
So far, parsing of the unzipped odg is done.
Also, an all together new bmp image is created. 
The only part remains is to link the odg information to bmp creation, i.e. The Bridge.
Submitted file is an example of bmp file using my own idea and not what the odg is about.
