DISCRIPTION:
This is an image converter from odg to bmp.
This converter uses expat.h libraby to parse the xml imformation stored in .odg files.
The renaming of files, zipping and unzipping, everything is automated.
bmp file is made using a 2-D array. The height and width of bmp is adjusted according to the size of odg image.
The bmp so formed will be purely be result of a 2D array and not any other graphic libraby. I have tried to make it as original as possible.

I hope you find my project intresting.
